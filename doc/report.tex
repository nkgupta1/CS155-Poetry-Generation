\section{Tokenizing}
\medskip

\subsection{What methods did you use and try to tokenize the sonnets?}
\subsection{Did you have to make changes to the way you tokenized after running the algorithm and seeing the results?}


\section{Algorithm}
\medskip

\subsection{What packages did you use for the algorithm?}
\subsection{What decisions did you have to make when running the algorithm and what did you try? e.g number of states}
\subsection{How did this affect the sonnets that were generated}

\section{Poetry Generation}
\medskip

\subsection{How did you generate your poem?}
\subsection{How did you get your poem to look as much like a sonnet as possible?}
\subsection{What makes sense/what doesn't about the sonnets generated?}


\section{Visualization and Interpretation}
\medskip

\subsection{For at least 5 hidden states give a list of the top 10 words that associate with this hidden state and
state any common features these groups.}
\subsection{What are some properties of the different hidden states?}
\subsection{e.g. Correlation between hidden states and syllable counts, connotations of words, etc.}
\subsection{Make a visual representation of the correlation between states and words}


\section{Additional Goals}
\medskip

\subsection{e.g. rhyme/meter}


\section{Extra Credit}
\medskip

\subsection{What did you use to collect more data and what packages did you use for RNN/LSTM?}
\subsection{Compare/contrast the effect of these algorithms to HMM and why you think they were better or worse}


\section{Conclusion}
\medskip

\subsection{How was the work divided up?}
\subsection{What are your conclusions/observations about the models you used and the sonnets generated?}
